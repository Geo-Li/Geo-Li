<p>
  Hey there, I'm Zhuoyuan (Geo) Li, a dedicated Computer Science graduate student at Northwestern University with a specialization in AI from UCI. I'm on the lookout for software engineering internships and full-time gigs. I've got a solid background in software development, including web dev, backend management, game dev, and AI applications. I love learning new things and am always up for a challenge. Recently, I've been diving into personal projects to sharpen my skills and create maintainable, real-world applications. Let's connect, share ideas, and grow together in the realms of software and game development!

    <strong>
      Plan Ahead and Focus on Improving
    </strong>
  </summary>
  <br/>
  <p>
    A wise man once said: "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." – Benjamin Franklin. I used to explore different tools and skills without any plan. As I grew more ambitious about learning various aspects of programming, I realized the importance of managing my time and energy. Planning ahead helps me tackle one thing at a time without losing track of where I am and what I should prepare for next. Therefore, I'll list what I plan to do in the near future and mark what I have completed to show my progress in learning and improving.

  - [x] 🎨 Add a README for My GitHub Profile: Create a project that's entirely README-driven, resembling a portfolio-styled README.
  - [x] 🎨 Enhance Existing GitHub Projects Readability: Apply the GitHub profie README insights to other GitHub projects to improve readability.
    - [x] README for my [Advanced Mechatronics Projects](https://github.com/Geo-Li/Advanced-Mechatronics-Projects/blob/main/README.md) (Done before the GitHub profile README 😂).
  - [ ] 🔗 Add links to this profile page, including pages with pictures I've taken, YouTubers I believe are knowledgeable and helpful, and a page listing all the great articles I find.
  - [ ] 📂 Manage My LinkedIn Page: Add critical sections such as projects, experiences, and skills to better present myself.
  - [ ] 🏞️ Add Pictures to My Portfolio: Include pictures of myself, climbing activities, and designs like webpages, breadboards, games, and interesting snaps of food or scenic spots. (People will know me better through images I guess)
  - [ ] 🔔 Add Progress Bars and Feedback Buttons for Projects: Introduce progress bars to my portfolio projects and an "I want to see this!" button for feedback and assign priorities to these projects.
  - [ ] 💼 Start Looking for Full-Time Jobs: Assess how my skills fare in the real world and be ready to learn from the challenges.
  - [ ] 🎮 Game Development Inspired by Climbing: Upon finishing or pausing my current animal whisking simulator game, begin a new game inspired by climbing. (Imagine throwing yourself out for bouldering!)
  - [ ] 📝 Update My Resume and Cover Letter More Frequently: Although I'm reluctant, I need to update these regularly!

## 📖 Knowledge is the Gift of Learning 📚

    <strong>
      Why I Suddenly Started Learning New Things
    </strong>
  </summary>
  </br>
  <p>
    I have to confess, what brought me to this industry had nothing to do with some grand dream or lofty expectations. At the very beginning of my UCI days, I took the advice of my friends, who said this field is both well-paid and intellectually challenging. At first, I found I had a knack for coding and enjoyed solving problems. But as I delved deeper, I realized there's so much more to software development than just writing lines of code.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's not just about learning a few programming languages or mastering some tools. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I didn't know. Each project, whether in school or during internships, revealed a bigger picture of the programming world that I hadn't seen before. A successful software engineer isn't just someone who completes assignments or follows the well-trodden path; it's someone who constantly learns and adapts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though I'm far from being a seasoned software engineer or algorithm guru, I'm on a journey of continuous learning and skill development. In the space below, I'll share some of the things I've picked up recently in the intricate and fascinating world of programming.

      What Geo's Doing Lately?
    </strong>
  </summary>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I'm actively looking for jobs and currently practicing with two internships. One is at MyEdMaster, where I helped build a SAT game for people to practice while having fun and generated many cool SAT questions using OpenAI models. The other is at SkyIT, where I've been involved in many departments but mainly worked on leading the development team to build a management system that helps the company manage employee performance and assign tasks accordingly. I'll share more when I have time.
  </p>
  <p>
    One more thing! I recently moved to New Jersey to take care of my friend's cat while he's back in China for the summer. His name is Xixi (希希), which is an intimate way to say hope in Chinese.
